Ross Milne is releasing Foxtrot in early 2010 through Typotheque. It's a slab serif with charming curves and a beautiful ampersand, designed for display sizes. It's friendly without being feminine and bold without being overpowering. I think you can expect to see this in a thousand different places, beginning in 2010. Hopefully, my work will be one of them.
