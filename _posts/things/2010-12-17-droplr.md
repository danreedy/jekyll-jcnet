The idea of [Droplr](http://droplr.com) is simpleâ€”it's a Mac application that lives in your menu bar, and you can drop files on it to share them. This uploads your file and automatically copies a shortened URL to your clipboard so you can share it. This works for all types of files, too. [Images](http://drp.ly/3Zn6t), [PDFs](http://drp.ly/3Af6M), ZIP archives, and more. It even automatically colors and [formats code](http://droplr.com/9lw2J). It's become an indispensable part of my workflow for sharing bits of information.
