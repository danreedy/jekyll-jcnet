I only keep a few things on me, so it was silly to carry a scoliosis-inducing booster seat wallet. For years, I've been using a [binder clip](http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&rls=en&q=binder%20clip&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi) to keep my stuff together. It worked well, apart from slowly destroying my things and occasionally clamping down on my butt. Then I got [this](http://www.saddlebackleather.com/65-product-categories-Leather-Bags-Leather-Briefcases-Leather-Suitcases-Leather-Backpacks) minimal, functional, solid wallet, guaranteed for 100 years. Saddleback Leather Company creates a great experience, guiding you from the build of the leather to selecting the right color. If you're in the market for a wallet, this is the way to go.
