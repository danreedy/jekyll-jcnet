<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Here be nerdery and hackery that will be more valuable to future Googlers than most who would occasionally read these thoughts. Also, a Mac and <a href="http://panic.com/transmit">Transmit</a> by Panic are here used.<sup id="2010_01_02_fnlink1"><a href="2010_01_02_fn1">1</a></sup></p>

	<li id="2010_01_02_fn1">Here is my setup: a <a href="http://site5.com">site5</a> server with PHP5 and a MySQL database. And locally, an iMac running Snow Leopard that stays on 24/7, backs up via Time Machine. Also, Automator (which you have if you're following so far) and Transmit. I don't know enough to know if your mileage will vary, so plan accordingly. <a href="#2010_01_02_fnlink2">Jump back</a></li>
	<li id="2010_01_02_fn2">I'm extremely happy with site5 and trust them tremendously. But I do want myself, not them, to be accountable for things that belong to me&mdash;in this case, intellectual property. <a href="#2010_01_02_fnlink2">Jump back</a></li>
