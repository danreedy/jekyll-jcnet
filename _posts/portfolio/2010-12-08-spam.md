I created [this site](http://joshuacody.net/spam/) simply as a project to play with CodeIgniter, particularly Phil Sturgeon's [Prowl library](http://philsturgeon.co.uk/code/codeigniter-prowl). You enter a message, and it automatically notifies me via phone. This sort of system is useful for side administrators to get real-time updates.
