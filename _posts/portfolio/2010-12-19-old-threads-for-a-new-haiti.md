A good cause on a quick turnaround, [Old Threads for a New Haiti](http://oldthreadsforanewhaiti.org/) went from concept to completion in 6 hours. Essentially, a good friend approached me to help his small group get a site up to get used clothes in the hands of Haitians. We pulled this together, and we're looking forward to tons of clothes being donated.
