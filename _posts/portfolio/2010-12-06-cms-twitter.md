[This site](http://joshuacody.net/twitter) was an experiment to see how we could provide a Twitter stream of church marketing content for fans of [Church Marketing Sucks](http://churchmarketingsucks.com/). Eventually, Twitter lists rendered this useless, but it was fun to build my first actual web application, albeit a small one.
