This was originally going to be [the look for a revised personal site](http://joshuacody.net/birdseye), but it ended up relegated to playing second-fiddle. I had a lot of fun playing with the portfolio item navigation elements and pulling in a feed of my online activity, but the look just wasn't quite what I was going for.
