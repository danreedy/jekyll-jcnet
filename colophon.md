### On Joshua Cody, Personally

Joshua (hereafter, "Josh") resides in [Portland, Oregon][port] in the shadow of Mount Hood with his (hereafter, singular) [beautiful wife][cc] and [spotted dog][sd]. The two of us spend sunny days riding bicycles, throwing [frisbees][fr], taking [photographs][fl], taking drives, crossing bridges, participling verbs, and more. The other half of the days, we spend eating [burritos][br] and crying.

We're also part of a wonderful community down in the Woodstock neighborhood in Portland who look to share Jesus by loving one another and loving the city. It's a lot of fun, and if you're reading this, then you're invited to hang out.

My most-played artists in iTunes include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copeland_(band)">Copeland</a>, [Death Cab for Cutie][dc], [Iron & Wine][iw], [Brand New][bn], [The Decemberists][d], and the [Drive-By Truckers][dbt]. Literarily, some favorites are *[The War of Art][twoa]*, *[Candide][ca]*, *[Celebration of Discipline][cod], *[The Elements of Typographic Style][eots]*, and *[Orthodoxy][o]*.

### On me, Professionally

I'm passionate about creating great user experiences on the web.

That looks like understanding users and their desires, then delivering something that's both simple and enjoyable to use. From Photoshop to JavaScript, I look to create fast, intuitive, delightful experiences.

I love clean, accessible, standards-compliant HTML and CSS, and I'm excited about the maturation of JavaScript and the surrounding community. If you're looking for fundamentally-sound design that's a pleasure to look at and use on the web, go ahead and contact me.

Or if you want to look it over some more, you can click on over to my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> and see the types of things I've been making lately.
