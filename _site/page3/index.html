    		<p>Recently, I was reading an <a href="http://www.cultofmac.com/john-sculley-on-steve-jobs-the-full-interview-transcript/63295">interview with former Apple CEO John Sculley</a> on Steve Jobs. By far, my favorite snippet was this, as Sculley describes Jobs’ admiration for Dr. Edward Land, co-founder of Polaroid:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both of them had this ability to not invent products, but discover products. Both of them said these products have always existed – it’s just that no one has ever seen them before. We were the ones who discovered them. The Polaroid camera always existed and the Macintosh always existed — it’s a matter of discovery.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It goes hand-in-hand with John Gruber’s description of Stanley Kubrick discovering the perfect camera angle in his wonderful talk, <a href="http://2010.dconstruct.org/speakers/john-gruber">The Auteur Theory of Design</a>.</p>

<p>Things already exist—perfect camera angles, ingenious product ideas, beautiful songs, new strategies. But we have to have patience and dedication, then put ourselves in positions to discover them.</p>

    		<p class="note">**Foreword:** This matter has rolled around in my head for no small amount of time now. We'll see if I can write about it aptly. I'd like to clarify that this is an indictment of myself before any others. It's a way of thinking and a struggle I've found myself wrapped in. And many, if not most, if not all, of the people who come to your mind during this reading are **phenomenal** people. I'm not criticizing any **one person** but a system in general. You may continue.</p>

<h3 id="the-church">The Church</h3>

<p>The economics of creating a version of a secular product and aiming it at churchgoers are alive and well. This used to be primarily t-shirts and sermon themes. These, thankfully, became passe and generally the subject of ridicule. Lately, something new seems to have emerged. I wouldn’t argue that it’s the same thing or spearheaded by the same people, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s equally silly.</p>

<p>I’m talking about Christian <a href="http://8bit.io/">blog networks</a>, Christian <a href="http://stuffchristianslike.net/">Stuff White People Like</a>, Christian conferences, et al. The market of “Christian” + [secular idea or product name] is alive and well, recession notwithstanding. Don’t listen to me, just note the 440,778 pixels of ad space on <a href="http://churchcrunch.com/weekly-top-commenters-7/">Christian TechCrunch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>An aside:</strong> Can we please stop using Christian as an adjective to describe inanimate objects. Your blog is not a Christian. Your book is not a Christian. I know it’s convenient and has become accepted usage, but maybe we could push away from that?</p>

<p>Moving along. We want to ask bold questions on our blog. We don’t want to be like the Christians that came before us. We want to be forward-thinking, break new ground, create conversations, tweetup, lead the social media revolution, and more. So we blog, and then other Christians comment on our blog. Or we create conferences, and other Christians attend our conferences.</p>

<p>We create a peer group completely isolated from those in the world who do not ascribe the term “Christian” to themselves.</p>

<h3 id="the-resistance">The Resistance</h3>

<p>If you haven’t read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">The War of Art</a>, you’re cheating yourself. In it, Steven Pressfield lays out a fairly simple thesis: <em>You were put on this earth for a purpose—to do some sort of work. And there is a force that opposes that work and manifests itself in a multitude of ways, which can be called <strong>Resistance</strong>.</em></p>

<p>He doesn’t make many assumptions about the particulars of what endows purpose or what is behind Resistance, but he does posit that both are spiritual issues. The Resistance can look like a lot of things: disorderly work spaces, distractions, unhealthy relationships, and so on and so forth. He’s actually fairly ruthless in his ascription of Resistance.</p>

<p>I’d argue that “Christian” things have become Resitance for Christians. It’s much easier to blog or attend conferences of like-minded individuals or start a Christian golf cart company than it is to go about our lives, spend time with people in some way unlike ourselves, and have constructive conversations about the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>What if we mess up? What if we tell them Jesus loves them regardless of whatever shortcomings we perceive them to have, but then we find that we don’t love them? What if we are convicted about something? What if we just don’t like them? What if we become entangled in relationships to the point that we have to stop using <strong>we</strong> and <strong>them</strong> language, but we become them, and they become us? Will my friends from church still like me? What if I find out that in practice, my theology is wrong, and I have to change what I believe?</p>

<p>Those are hard questions. They’re scary questions. Know what’s not hard and scary? Christian golf carts.</p>

<h3 id="doing-your-work">Doing Your Work</h3>

<p>All things to all men, cultural sensitivity, relativity, effective communication. I know, I know. But I do find it hard to imagine that Jesus would spend precious seconds of his life firing up his Google Reader, clicking over to [insert blog name here], and commenting on whether iPads are going to be the future of church communication.</p>

<p>I’m a little averse to the idea of “What would Jesus do?” thing as a life choice metric as it assumes we know the correct answer to that question, so I don’t want you to put too much stock in the preceding paragraph. But we do need to ask ourself what <strong>we</strong> are to do.</p>

<p>I personally came to the realization that I was living in Resistance. My job was in a church. My writing was for a blog aimed at churches. My friends were from church. I was practically <a href="http://chickfila.com/">eating at a church</a>. But unless someone stumbled into the church I worked at or happened to stumble upon something I wrote, I wasn’t influencing or being influenced by people unlike myself. And when your work is to make disciples, that’s not a healthy balance.</p>

<p>So my big ask is that we stop trying to become the next big thing in Christian culture or create the next huge Christian blog or start the next giant conference. Let’s do stuff, then write about it later instead of just blogging.</p>

<p>Less talking, more doing. Instead of creating a new site focused on iPad applications for emerging Christian leaders of the next generation catalyst synergy, coach your kid’s soccer team. Make cookies for your coworkers. Consider supporting your neighborhood association instead of paying airfare plus hotel plus rental car plus meals plus conference tickets.</p>

<p>Re-evaluate what your work is and what it should be, and make sure the two align well.</p>

    	<div class="blog_body">		
    		<p>23 years ago today, a black sedan pulled into the parking lot of a nondescript brick building. The kind you see everywhere in the suburbs. Built at an indeterminable time between 1975 and 2000, faux columns, concrete stairs. You've seen them before.</p>
<p>The film flickers, the camera shakes, whispers become louder. The driver of the car approaches the rear, passenger-side door. Click. Creak. The camera drops. Now there is talking and shouting.</p>
<p class="big_quote">"It's Joshua!"</p>
<p class="big_quote">"Hold the camera, momma! No, no, take it, Steve!"</p>
<p>Feet shuffle. Nervous pacing becomes spirited jogging. The camera switches to a nausea-inducing view of pavement, but the tape records the laughter and tears and shouts.</p>
<p>You can't plan for moments like this. You think you'll film the whole thing. You think you'll hold the camera steady. But you're kidding yourself.</p>
<p>The moment you meet your child for the first time isn't a moment for planning, composure, and efficiency. It's not a moment that's filmed by Ken Burns and narrated by James Earl Jones. It's a moment filmed by dad and narrated by mom, both raptured a thousand times more than they expected when the back door opens.</p>
<h3>The Delivery</h3>
<p>This is the story of my birth.</p>
<p>I've watched the film time and time again. I've seen myself delivered from whatever unsure future I faced into the arms of loving and caring parents who wanted nothing more than happiness and success for me.</p>
<p>I've seen the beauty and power of adoption first-hand.</p>
<p>Before I was born, my father was born, in Ireland. Both his mother and father died, and he too was adopted—into the United States. Somehow, some way, out of an Irish orphanage and into a Massachusetts home. Were it not for adoption, I'd never be here.</p>
<p>Before my mother was born, her father was adopted. His mother died, and his father was a drunk who gave his sister away for a bottle of whiskey. Were it not for adoption, I'd never be here.</p>
<h3>The Friends</h3>
<p>Caroline and I have always had a soft spot for adoption and imagined it was part of our future. And in the last year, we've watched the <a href="http://twitter.com/lolaseay">Seays</a>, the <a href="http://babyvogeltanz.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/img_0205.jpg">Vogeltanzs</a>, the <a href="http://jonesfamilyadoption.com/blog/">Joneses</a>, the <a href="http://twitter.com/jasonlohse/status/10732548577">Lohses</a> and the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/monkeyouttanowhere/3407282933/in/photostream">Hendricks</a> either begin or end the adoption process.</p>
<p>We're beyond grateful to have such wonderful people in our lives—full of love and grace and humility. We believe in them, and we believe in their cause. We believe in their cause because we believe it's our cause and your cause. Adoption matters.</p>
<h3>The Plug</h3>
<p>Kevin Hendricks recently wrote <a href="http://www.kevindhendricks.com/books/adoption/"><em>Addition by Adoption</em></a>, an hilarious look at adoption, parenting, and life. Kevin is a stand-up guy and a great writer, and he and his wife, Abby, live out what they believe.</p>
<p>So the purposes of this little story and plug are twofold: one, to let you know about what Kevin is doing. And two, if you are considering adoption, I want to buy you a copy. So here's what to do:</p>
<p><strong>Ahem.</strong> The instructions used to be to comment, but they were from a previous version of this site where comments were in existence. But rest assured, a lucky soul received a copy of Kevin's book.</p>

    		<p>Efficiency is a friend to business and productivity, but it's an enemy of community. Trust and lasting relationships are built on the belief that the other party values <strong>you</strong> more than they value <strong>themselves</strong>.</p>

<p>And in order to truly value others, we set aside our schedules and plans. We let our coffee meetings run to two hours. We spontaneously drive an hour to Sonic. We take an hour on the phone even though we have a thousand other things to do.</p>

<p>If you're trying to keep your community efficient, you're depriving yourselves and those around you. Relationships are inefficient, but they're worth it.</p>

    		<p>Caroline and I are staying at a hotel in San Diego to get a three-day break from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon#Climate">winter in Portland</a>. We fly for nearly free thanks to parents at Delta, I can work from the road, and we scored a great deal on our accommodations on <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline</a>. Despite the good price, I'd never stay here again, but I'm not going to complain about it.</p>
<p>The guest representative let us know the airport shuttle would arrive in ten minutes, but it took an hour. I have called the front desk multiple times with no answer. Our bed smells like tacky perfume. The sink leaks to the bathroom floor. None of these things are major, but they add up. And, based on my experience as in high school statistics, four problems are not an anomaly, they are systemic.</p>
<h3>Dang man, tell them!</h3>
<p>I won't mention it. I'm not the complaining type. I tend to eschew conflict where possible, try not to be disruptive, and worry that I'm simply being a pain <sup id="2010_02_15_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_02_15_fn1">1</a></sup>. I'm having a great time with my wife exploring a new city, and I have better things to do than fight with an underpaid, overworked hotel manager.</p>
<p>But I'll never be back.</p>
<p>This is where it's important to use your own service, personally solicit feedback, get things right the first time, and fix problems before people ever complain. For every guest, customer, or individual who complains, there are plenty who don't. Who you'll never get back. Who are costing you money.</p>
<h3>So what? You just got it on <a href="http://priceline.com">Priceline</a>.</h3>
<p>Every customer is just as valuable as another. Whether they are providing profit or helping to cut the loss, they're doing you a favor by choosing your organization. Whether they're using <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org/">Webkit nightly builds</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_7">Internet Explorer</a>, they're still a customer. Never become of the mind that one customer is more valuable than another. They're customers, and they're serving you. It's your job to give them the best possible experience.</p>
<p>If you're married to utilitarianism, then think of it this way: You don't know how frequently any given customer will return. You don't know their network and influence. You don't know when and where they'll review your organization. And as a business-owner, you can't afford to take a chance that their impact will be disproportionate to their price point.</p>
<h3>Too negative, shut up.</h3>
<p>All right, how about this? Same trip story.</p>
<p>My wife and I had lunch at <a href="http://chickfila.com/">Chick-fil-a</a> here in San Diego. And some friends here in San Diego were so gracious to drive us&mdash;us being without a car and all. We ordered lunch for ourselves and friends, and one of the eight total items we ordered was not ready at the same time as the others.</p>
<p>They graciously informed us that they'd bring the sandwich to our table when it was ready. We didn't complain. No big deal. But when they brought it, they brought a coupon for a free meal along with it.</p>
<p>Later in the day, after our friends were gone, we took our coupon, bought two bus passes, and rode 30 minutes back to Chickfila.</p>
<p>Now <strong>that</strong> is how you proactively address problems and build intense loyalty.</p>
<ol>
    <li id="2010_02_15_fn1">I'm framing this trait positively. It's not without its downfalls of problems that grow unnecessarily large, miscommunications, and avoidable relational pain. <a href="#2010_02_15_fnlink1" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>

    		<p>Those of you who know me are likely to know I've been on the job hunt for awhile now. Little was changing for about seven months, and it was getting fairly discouraging. Unfortunately, the temptation to define our value based on external validation is part of the human condition. It just happens. But then, two-weeks-ago happened.</p>
<p>Between Tuesday and Wednesday, I received three job offers. I was on the verge of making my decision Sunday when another organization called to ask me to come in that afternoon for a pitch. Seven months unemployed, I had four people to give a final decision on Monday.</p>
<h3>Why I Said That Stuff</h3>
<p>This isn't an exercise in hubris. I was obviously unemployable for seven months; I would like to emphasize that. Some days I considered going out and applying for jobs that would have likely rendered me fairly unhappy. It's not fun to watch <a href="http://twitter.com/carolinecody">your wife</a> work her tail off for five months while you freelance, look for jobs, and eat kettle chips.</p>
<p>But in those seven months, I pursued something I love. I tried things. I tried lots of different things. I learned the niche that I learned that I loved within the thing that I learned that I loved. I found people who were amazing at the thing that I learned that I loved and the niche that I learned that I loved within the thing that I learned that I loved.</p>
<p>I read. I worked. I <a href="http://joshuacody.net/portfolio">created things to work on</a> when people weren't paying me to work. I thought. I wrote. I thought some more. I tried not to incessantly refresh <a href="http://cnn.com">cnn.com</a> and <a href="http://espn.com">espn.com</a>. I waitied. I wrote about what I thought and why I thought it.</p>
<p>And then I had the amazing opportunity to say no to three people.</p>
<p>But even more, I had the opportunity to say yes to <a href="http://qworky.com">Qworky</a>.</p>
<h3>What I'll be doing</h3>
<p>Well, Qworky has a product. It's a product that's going to be a pretty big help to a lot of people. A product I believe in. A product that will have a website as soon as I finish making it. And Qworky has a team. A team of smart guys and girls who really believe in the product, genuinely care about people, and are smart as a whip.</p>
<p>I'll be the <strong>QX Developer</strong>, which is short for Qworky Experience Developer. I'll be taking their product and helping them make it a dream for you to use. Taking every hurdle possible that's between you and your work and leave it crying in the corner. Helping you get from waking up to doing what you love to not doing what you love and instead doing what you love to do outside of work.</p>
<p>I'll be doing a little freelancing for some time, wrapping up old projects and perhaps starting some new ones. But mostly, I'll be thinking about experiences, which thrills me to no end. I'll leave my nose in articles such as <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?968">this</a>, <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/the-problem-with-passwords/">this</a>, and <a href="http://52weeksofux.com/post/385981737/the-usage-lifecycle">this</a>. I'll work from <a href="http://stumptowncoffee.com/locations/downtown">here</a>. And I'll get one of <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=german%20shorthaired%20pointer&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">these</a>.</p>
<p>I feel fortunate and inspired that so many people who know me prayed for me, thought of me, connected me with opportunities, and truly cared for me. I feel grateful that I have a wife who worked so hard and waited so patiently while her husband sought his passion.</p>
<p>But most of all, I feel encouraged, and I hope you do too, that hard work, dedication, risks, and dreams still lead to great promise and opportunities. I hope you'll take these words as a challenge and encouragement to find and do whatever you love. To surround yourself with great people. And to live a fuller life.</p>

And previously, on the iPhone. But they're framing this discussion in the wrong way.</p>
<h3>Apple can't do multitasking</h3>
<p>For some reason, this is how the debate is framed. "Apple can't figure it out." "The processor isn't powerful enough." "No multitaskz?! Apple FAIL!!11!."</p>
<p>The fundamental issue here isn't that Apple can't figure out how to offer multitasking or can't come up with the technology for it. The technology community keeps having that discussion again and again.</p>
<p>The real issue is that Apple doesn't want multitasking. Apple, like <a href="http://www.davecrenshaw.com/the-myth-of-multitasking.php">Dave Crenshaw</a>, knows something that most of us are too stubborn to concede. <strong>Multitasking causes problems.</strong></p>
<h3>Problems? What problems?</h3>
<p>For the casual user, multiple simultaneous applications present a paradigm problem. The model is abstracted too much. You have an application, in which you have a window (many times abstracted further by tabs), in which you have the tasks you wish to complete. At any given point, you might have zero windows open or one thousand windows open. Either situation brings confusion.</p>
<p>For the power user, multiple simultaneous applications present a paradigm problem. Too often I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-toomany.jpg" alt="Too many applications" width="430" height="269" class="center" /></p>
<p>Just before I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-psquit.jpg" alt="Photoshop Quit" width="430" height="168" class="center" /></p>
<p>Or I end up with this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010-02-05-toowide.jpg" alt="Too Wide" width="430" height="85" class="center" /></p>
<p>All of which are confusing and irritating situations for me. I can imagine this is only exacerbated if someone is simply a casual computer user or new to computing altogether.</p>
<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>Apple, however, implicitly proposes a solution.</p>
<p>Allow multitasking. But by making switching applications just as simple as running multiple applications at the same time.</p>
<p>You want to multitask with applications? Just close one, open the other, and the SDK will allow developers to automatically save your state. System-level cut, copy, and paste also mean you can easily transfer text and images between applications.</p>
<p>Now, you no longer have to deal with multiple applications being open, memory being eaten by tasks you're unaware of, or crashes from too many things going on at once.</p>
<p>If each of my applications would open via a simple process in a near-instant, my need for multiple applications would be nearly obliterated.</p>
<p>Not <strong>completely</strong> though. From time-to-time I need to split windows like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2010_02_05_splitscreen.jpg" alt="Split screen windows" width="430" height="269" class="center" /></p>
<p>And I consider some of my utilities that run in the background as non-negotiables (looking at you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blacktree-alchemy/">Quicksilver</a>, <a href="http://www.smileonmymac.com/TextExpander/">TextExpander</a>, <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">1Password</a>, and <a href="http://droplr.com/hello">Droplr</a>.)</p>
<p>But you know who doesn't? Your mom. Or the average user.</p>
<p>Apple isn't looking to replace your MacBook Pro. Or your Mac Pro. Perhaps OS 11 will take things in the direction of the iPhone OS, but I hope not, and I doubt it.</p>
<p>What they've done is made a consumer-level machine that removes abstractions. No application/window/tabs/tasks model. No mouse and click model. No desktop metaphor.</p>
<p>It's not a failure. Or a misstep. Or a dealbreaker. It's just not a computer for you and your creative power. But for John Doe, the iPad is the future of computing.</p>

    		<p>In a <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/2009/12/rt_illustration_moby-dick.html">link roundup</a> over a month ago, John Nack from Adobe linked thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://bit.ly/90bmx7">How to make dotted borders in Photoshop</a>. (Not hard, but we should simplify the process.) [<a href="http://twitter.com/thinsoldier">Via</a>]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on Twitter, he said essentially the same thing, although not in the link roundup context:</p>
<blockquote><p>How to make dotted borders in Photoshop: <a href="http://bit.ly/90bmx7">http://bit.ly/90bmx7</a> (Not hard, but we should simplify it.) (via <a href="http://twitter.com/thinsoldier">@thinsoldier</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>This didn't sit right with me, but I wasn't sure how to communicate what I was feeling. Sitting here today, with who knows what inspiration, it hit me.</p>
<p class="big_quote">In interfaces and systems, you should treat users like they're dumb. In conversations, this should never be the case.</p>
<p>Simplify your experiences, then simplify them some more. Provide simple assistance along the way. Any time users have to ask for help or misunderstand something, that's your fault, not theirs. Your experiences should aim to be intuitive and simple for <em>anyone</em> that you would like to use them.</p>
<p>This trick, shared by Jesse Bennett-Chamberlain, was making the rounds because it was a significant help to Photoshop users. No one at Adobe should write this off as, "not hard." Obviously, it is hard. And that's their problem, not the users'.</p>

    		<p>Lately, I've been particularly impressed by the idea that actual market saturation is a point much higher than I would anticipate. More simply, the sandbox is a lot bigger than I realized.</p>
<p>I tend to think, "Oh, someone is already doing X, so I need to think of something new." More and more, I'm realizing how wrong I am.</p>
<p>I'm coming to a point where I want to <em>recognize my main competitors as my best contributors</em>.</p>
<h3>The iPad Again</h3>
<p>I think Microsoft misses the boat here with their reality distortion field around Apple products. I'll include a couple of quotes that come to mind:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Watson claimed that many developers of applications for the iPhone OS–which the iPad uses–are not making money. Developing applications for the iPhone and iPad is expensive, he said, because iPhone OS uses the Objective-C language rather than Microsoft’s more pervasive .NET platform. And Apple’s control over the platform has alienated some people that make software for its products, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote_caption">Brandon Watson, Microsoft Director of Product Management, on the iPad (via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/29/msft-ipad">Daring Fireball</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually take a look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="quote_caption">Steve Ballmer on the iPhone (via <a href="http://www.electronista.com/articles/07/04/30/ballmer.on.iphone/">Electronista</a>)</p>
<p>I think Microsoft displays an old model of business here. Armchair analysis and hours of watching <a href="http://www.amctv.com/originals/madmen/">Mad Men</a> confirm that this practice took hold as marketing and advertising rose to greater prominence with the television. If you could tell everyone why that other brand of adult undergarments was underperforming<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink3"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn3">1</a></sup>, then they would select your brand by default.</p>
<h3>A different, better mindset</h3>
<p>But are these really the customers you want? The kind who just blindly believe you that the other guy is less good? And further, in this age where reviews are so accessible, your press release or off-hand public quote carry little value.</p>
<p>Instead, praise innovation. Praise your competitors. Assure your customers that you're excited that the bar is raised and you can't wait to deliver an even better product with these new ideas and some of your own.</p>
<p>There is more than enough room for two creators of operating systems. There is more than enough room for another concrete company, coffee shop, or whatever you're passionate about. But build on the work of your competitors, praise what they're doing, and make yourself better in some way. That's where success lives.</p>

    		<p>Earlier today, <a href="http://twitter.com/nevenmrgan">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/siracusa">John Siracusa</a> were having a little chat about the adequacy of the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/various_ipad_thoughts">automatic and manual transmission metaphor</a> making the rounds in the iPad context.</p>
<p>If you don't know Neven<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn1">1</a></sup>, he's a bright and kind guy. But given his brightness, he tends to disagree with people online sometimes. Particularly, the aforementioned conversation and the occasional banter with <a href="http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies">Merlin Mann</a>. And when he disagrees, he wants to keep it nice. So he adds a colon-parenthases emoticon<sup id="2010_01_29_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_29_fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Over time, this gets awkward, and it brought me to a simple realization, which I shall call Neven's Law. It can ring true of Twitter, online chatting, and email. Essentially, any digital, written communication:</p>
<p class="big_quote">The appropriateness of a medium is inversely proportional to the number of emoticons necessary in a given discussion.</p>
<p>Now, I appreciate them having these conversations in public so the masses can participate. But now that we have a law, perhaps we can apply it and bump these conversations up to the easiest-possible theater where emoticons are no longer necessary. </p>
<p>Or, we can continue with our emoticons&mdash;using them as clues for the audience that, "this would be better said elsewhere." But there you have it. Now go forth with your new knowledge and continue discussing.</p>

    		<p>The iPad has generated lots of discussion about computing metaphors, computer interactions, and general technology. Of course, there's been plenty of the usual banter as the masses decry the closed platform, the evils of the App Store, the lack of an optical drive, and so on and so forth. That's to be expected of anything worth discussing.</p>
<h3>Creation and Consumption</h3>
<p>But I'm particularly intrigued at the discussion of creation versus consumption circling around <a href="http://al3x.net/2010/01/28/ipad.html">Alex Payne</a>, <a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/blog/2010/01/28/on-the-ipad-for-serious-this-time/">Joshua Blankenship</a>, <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/01/27/iPad">Tim Bray</a>, and <a href="http://createdigitalmusic.com/2010/01/27/how-a-great-product-can-be-bad-news-apple-ipad-and-the-closed-mac/">Peter Kirn</a>. The first two gentlemen, in particular, are men who create things that make me want to <strong>a) be better</strong> and <strong>b) give up because I'll never match them</strong>.</p>
<p>Joshua Blankeship had this to say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But the iPad is not designed to fill my desire to create, it’s mainly designed for me to consume the creations of others. It will change the landscape of personal computing and find its way into the hands of a ridiculous amount of people who are very happy to simply consume. My hands just won’t be among them anytime soon. I have too much creating to do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's a careful, caring guy. But I think he goes a bit too far here with his tone towards this machine.</p>
<p>The folks I've seen discussing this are in two fields&mdash;design and development. Ten inches of screen real estate and no physical keyboard aren't right for <em>their type of creation.</em> But for other creators, I think this device can really hit the sweet spot; especially at $499. Let's look at a few ways this could help creators:</p>
<h3>Types of Creators</h3>
<p><strong>Writers.</strong> Imagine <a href="http://www.ommwriter.com/">Ommwriter</a> on this thing, with the physical keyboard dock. You've got a 10-inch machine, capable and portable, that's <em>perfect</em> for writing extended works. Additionally, no multi-tasking has the benefit of no distractions. It's also nice for people who need to create short-form content on the road: bloggers, copywriters, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Photographers and designers.</strong> At $499, this would be a great second machine for creatives. Your portfolio, wireframes, sketches, etc. It's portability is key here. As a second machine, you could easily sketch things here as you spoke with a client, giving them visual feedback and brainstorming. And it works anywhere. Whiteboards are gigantic, and laptops are feature-rich. It's certainly a nice-to-have.</p>
<p><strong>Leaders.</strong> With iBooks and portability, a device like this can give leaders the flexibility to inspire and challenge others as they go about creating environments and cultures. I know plenty of leaders who <strong>love</strong> their netbook because it lets them do what they need and create what they need on the go. I'm confident the iPad will only work better for this audience.</p>
<p><strong>Learners.</strong> Creators are, by nature, learners. On your person, you can have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X">The Elements of Style</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326">The Elements of Typographic Style</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cormac_McCarthy#Published_works">A Cormac McCarthy novel</a>, your favorite photographer's entire portfolio, and anything else you need. There is a certain paralysis that comes with too much information, but there is also a certain freedom. I'd never be where I am today without the wealth of information made available online and the democratization of knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Takeaway</h3>
<p>I'm right with the spirit of what some of those before me have said. Creators have to constantly fight the battle of consumption paralysis. And ravenous consumption will inhibit the progress of many would-be creators.</p>
<p>And this device isn't geared for heavy-duty creation. But it can certainly help some people continue creating with more flexibility.</p>
<p>And what of consumption? Everyone consumes; it's inevitable. But it's not up to Apple what you consume. It's up to you.</p>

    		<p>Someone starts a vision with a vision, a dream, and a passion.</p>
<p>They want to provide quality healthcare to individuals. They want to put financial advice in the hands of young people moving into adulthood. They want to deliver news and opinions to the curious and entrepreneurial reader.</p>
<p>At what point do companies like these stop caring about users? How do these visionaries live with phone systems as daunting and frustrating as navigating across the Atlantic? How do these dreamers accept customer service policies that leave customers shouldering the burden and scrambling?</p>
<p class="big_quote">At some point, the people at the top of companies stop making innovations and start making excuses.</p>
<p>"We provide better service than some of our competitors."</p>
<p>"We're working as quickly as possible to upgrade our network."</p>
<p>"It's because potential customers are ignorant of our value."</p>
<p>Bull. It's because you've lost your way. You used to be passionate and <em>focused on your dream</em>. Now you're <em>focused on your bottom-line</em>, and you've lost your desire for meaning and perfection.</p>
<h3>A simple charge</h3>
<p>Make it easy for people to use your product or service. Shoulder every possible burden for your consumer. Let them talk to humans instead of machines. Make their interactions with you a <em>pleasure</em> instead of a <em>burden</em>.</p>
<p>Eventually, you just might end up with <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/technology/ByteOfTheApple/blog/archives/2010/01/almost_40_billi.html">$40 billion on hand</a>.</p>
<p>What, you want 10 ways? All right.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Send them email updates instead of making them log in</li>
    <li>Have a human answer your phone line in less than four rings, guaranteed.</li>
    <li>Whenever someone complains, give them something free, and send a hand-written apology letter.</li>
    <li>Pay someone to be in charge of your user experience online. Someone good.</li>
    <li>Let people login to your site with their email address.</li>
    <li>Have your executives answer phone calls and emails personally, for two hours each week.</li>
    <li>Apologize, early and often. Your customers are right, and you're wrong.</li>
    <li>Actively engage in social media. Don't bother with an account if it's not personal or interactive.</li>
    <li>Let users choose a charity to donate 5% of their sale to.</li>
    <li>Give random customers something free. Every 500th customer gets a gift card. Something like that. Don't publicize it, just do it.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the things that make your dream a pleasure to use. And when you don't do them, eventually, people find something else that <em>is</em> a pleasure.</p>

    		<p>In the vein of <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/on_disappointment">disappointment</a>, I have another question: Where are you setting your expectations? I think for most of us, the answer to that question is, "too low."</p>
<p>When you're investing in something, or more particular, someone, set your expectations high. You're investing in them because you see potential. And they're allowing you to invest in them because they believe you can cultivate that potential.</p>
<p>When you let them off the hook with half-ass work, you're doing them a disservice. It's easy for us to say, "That's all right, everyone fails sometimes." And there is certainly a time for it to be said. But more often, we should be saying, "Go back and do it better." If you prefer, you can preface it with "Good work."</p>
<p>It might come off as insensitive, but in the end, higher expectations mean better results. Whether you're in the business of creating products, delivering services, or developing individuals, that's a win-win situation.</p>
<p>When it comes to people, expect work, products, and character just a little bit better than you have ever seen from them before.</p>

<p>Always. So when you're feeling disappointed, ask yourself two questions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>What expectations were communicated that went unmet?</li>
	<li>What expectations were assumed, although never communicated?</li>
</ul>
<p>And when you're feeling angry, sad, or irritated? Ask yourself if what you <strong>actually</strong> are is disappointed.</p>

    		<p>Recently, I feel like I've been witness to a few too many ideas passing me by. Not passing me by for a lack of merit or an innate implausibility, but passing me by because my passion wanes.</p>
<p>I'm still wrestling with whether this is simply the nature of ideas or I rested on my laurels for too long. And I don't think it's an answer that will come easily.</p>
<p>But the point remains. In language that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/0446691437">Steven Pressfield</a> would approve of: when you've put yourself in the right position, and the muse is ready to touch you, you'd better be ready to throw everything else aside and chase her. She won't last long.</p>
<p>Jason Fried of 37 Signals <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/4717683?pg=embed&amp;sec=">said the same thing</a> much more eloquently in 2009 (excuse the huge quote wall, but it's <em>that</em> good):</p>
<blockquote><p>Inspiration is perishable. We all have ideas, and once you have the idea, the idea is sort of immortal. It lives on forever; it goes on forever. The idea exists, even if it's just in your head or you write it down, it's happened. But what isn't going to last forever is your inspiration for that idea. Inspirations are like fresh fruit, like milk—they have an expiration date, and they don't last very long.</p>
<p>If you happen to be lucky enough and fortunate enough to be inspired to do something, you've got to do it right now because every day you go, it gets browner and browner and deader and starts to rot and goes away. Inspiration is perishable, you can not hang on to it. So if you find something you want to do, you've just got to go out and do it.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you're in the business of creating, you'd better be ready to move quick. Nothing gold can stay.</p>

    	<div class="blog_body">		
    		<p>The New York Times reported today that The New York Times will begin <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/media/21times.html?src=twt&amp;twt=nytimesglobal">charging users for online access</a> after viewing a yet-to-be-determined number of free articles.</p>
<p>A quick Twitter search for "new york times" yields 15 first-page results&mdash;8 of which are negative reactions to this idea. (How's that for a scientific way of determining the pulse of the nation? Move over Anderson Cooper, I'm an iReporter.)</p>
<p>From the article about the plan:</p>
<blockquote><p>But executives of The New York Times Company said they could not yet answer fundamental questions about the plan, like how much it would cost or what the limit would be on free reading. They stressed that the amount of free access could change with time, in response to economic conditions and reader demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let's talk a little bit more about that.</p>
<h3>First, the good</h3>
<p>The idea of a fluctuating amount is great. I think this conveys trust in your brand and encourages constant interaction. It invites users to continually check your price and lets them know that you're being sensitive to their needs and current events. Kind of important for a paper.</p>
<p>And the idea of charging is good. You can't run your business at a loss. The internet is growing up, the dot-com bubble has bursted, re-inflated, and re-bursted. Let's find ways to monetize this thing or go back to working at the mill.</p>
<h3>But then, the bad</h3>
<p>I don't buy the idea that the problem is the payment. My parents' generation has been paying for newspapers since they were delivered by wooly mammoths. And the type of people who are interested in what the NYT has to say are the type of people who are willing to pay for it. Just because Facebook and Twitter are free doesn't mean everyone in the 18-25 demographic will never pay for anything again<sup id="2010_01_20_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_20_fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I'd posit that their "fundamental questions" are wrong. If I land on an NYT page asking me to pay for the content, do you know what's easier? Going back to Google and looking for the same thing on the Atlanta Journal Constitution or the Wall Street Journal. And do you know what's easier than logging in to read news? Not logging in to read news.</p>
<p>How they are going to solve <strong>this</strong> problem is the real question.</p>
<h3>Glad you asked</h3>
<p>For news, the initial shock of a login system and the inconvenience of it are simply too much. And I see two options for success.</p>
<p><strong>One</strong>. If the New York Times can succeed in this new world, it might require they develop a renewed voice and a stronger tribe.</p>
<p>The readers who define the NYT and the Wall Street Journal are getting old. They're going in to that last two-thirds of their life that we call "retirement."</p>
<p>These monolithic newspaper companies are now competing with fast, nimble organizations that aren't in the newspaper printing business. They're not even necessarily in the news business. Think <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fast Company</a>, <a href="http://37signals.com/">37 Signals</a>, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a>. Then think of the thousands of speciality-sites killing it in their own industry. For free<sup id="2010_01_20_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_20_fn2">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>You can try and compete with each of these in your traditional newspaper sections&mdash;technology, world, local, etc. Or you can try and compete with <a href="http://alltop.com/">Alltop</a> as an idea-aggregator. But either way, kick the notion that you're competing with the other local or national papers.</p>
<p>Wherever you decide to go, if you're going to charge, and if people are going to pay, you can't go on as you are.</p>
<p><strong>Two</strong>. Eliminate the interface barriers.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Develop the best damn news-delivery interface the world has ever seen. (Perhaps along the lines of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/timesskimmer/">Times Skimmer</a>?)</li>
    <li>Somehow beat Twitter for speed and the aforementioned "new competitors" for quality.</li>
    <li>Find a way to make login painless, or better, unnecessary. Err on the side of accidentally giving someone free access instead of accidentally making someone login.</li>
    <li>Convince your audience that your site is the <strong>single best place</strong> for them to get news, and never disappoint them when they come to you looking for something.</li>
</ul>
<p>I frankly don't know if solution two is possible. And in the end, surviving as a company might mean narrowing your focus, developing your voice, and accepting smaller revenues. People will pay, but ad revenue will shrink, and circulation will narrow. This is less-than-ideal for a business whose job is to increase revenue, but it's markedly better than bankruptcy.</p>

    		<p>Recently, I wrote of <a href="http://joshuacody.net/blog/the_two_types_of_value">two kinds of value</a>, particularly with regards to the things we consume. But there's something that defines us much more than the things we consume. And that's how we spend our <em>time</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>You could fill any arbitrary number of hours with what feels to be productive work. Between e-mail, and crucial web surfing, and to-do lists that, in the age of David Allen, grow to lengths that rival the bible, there is always something you could be doing. At some point, however, you have to put a stake in the ground and say: I know I have a never-ending stream of work, but this is when I’m going to face it. If you don’t, you’ll let this work push you around like a bully. It will force you into tiring, inefficient schedules, and you’ll end up more stressed and no more accomplished.</p>

    		<p>Great leaders are generous. Not as a marketing ploy. Not as a bait-and-switch tactic. Not because they're rich and have nothing better to do with their money. A story will better illustrate why. <sup id="2010_01_07_fnlink1"><a href="
#2010_01_07_fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3>A generous man</h3>
<p>One of the most skilled leaders I know is a man you'll likely never meet or read about in a leadership magazine. He owns a mechanical services company in Fayetteville, Georgia. Each year, he throws a Christmas party for all his employees, current and former, and their families. He lives modestly and gives luxuriously. Particularly, I want to tell you what he did for me one spring afternoon.</p>
<p>I was preparing for a short-term trip to Africa&mdash;3 months during the summer of 2006. I was also raising support (no negligible amount) for said trip, and as this man was a neighbor, friend, and former employer, he received a letter asking for financial support.</p>
<p>He contacted me to let me know he had something for me and told me he'd look for a time he was free to get together. Eventually, that time came. He called to ask me if I'd have a few hours in the afternoon. Eagerly, I obliged (and surely canceled any plans I might've had).</p>
<p>He lives about 200 yards from my parents, so I was a bit surprised to see him pull up in his truck that afternoon. He invited me to hop in, and he let me know we were going to run an errand together. Next stop, Lowe's.</p>
<p>As it turns out, a family from their church had a relative who was recently involved in a car accident. She survived, but with a drastically altered life as a quadriplegic. Our errand was to pick up a generator and deliver it to their family so the devices critical to her survival would continue to function in the event of a power outage.</p>
<p>It wasn't simply a give-and-run experience, either. We spent time laughing and talking with their family&mdash;hearing stories of the past and dreams for the future. And on the way out, they gave me the full tour of all this man had already done for them. Building a new deck that was wheelchair-friendly and covered. Converting the front door and patio to accomodate wheelchair access. Bringing meals over for their entire family. His generosity was staggering.</p>
<p>On our way home, he gave me a check that covered half of my entire trip.</p>
<h3>But why generosity?</h3>
<p>When leading others towards a just goal, a leader sets vision and direction, then empowers followers to act freely. Leaders generally don't make their investment in people with goals wildly different from their own, and they usually invest only where they see potential. Their generous investment delivers two things: resources and permission.</p>
<p>It's easy to see that financial generosity gives a recipient the means to move towards a common goal. What's not so obvious is the permission granted by the giving of time or attention. As a leader invests this way in others, she implicitly communicates that the other party <em>deserves</em> her most important resource. In turn, that person is naturally challenged to steward this investment wisely and push harder towards their shared goal.</p>
<p>For me, this investment reminded me that generosity is an essential part of being fully alive and bringing the Kingdom of God to earth. And I learned that generosity isn't an action, but a lifestyle. For his employees, annual Christmas parties are reminders of their value and potential. They actually mean something in his company, and their continued work is appreciated and valued.</p>
<p>Great leaders understand that they are leading people. Whole people. And they will never succeed in achieving goals without the generosity that empowers their co-laborers.</p>
<p>What are you leading others towards? And are you empowering them through your own generosity?<sup id="2010_01_07_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_07_fn2">2</a></sup></p>
<ol>
    <li id="2010_01_07_fn1">We're going to define a great leader as someone who is highly skilled at setting goals and motivating others to reach those goals together. We're also going to assume they do these things for just reasons.

    		<p>I think our internal value-meters are a bit dull these days. As we face a host of options and products daily, the simplest heuristic is to spread our time and money as thinly as possible. If we buy the most things at the least cost, then surely we will be met with satisfaction.</p>
<p>This is <strong>quantitative value</strong>.</p>
<h3>On quantitative value</h3>
<p>Recently, I've struggled with the ideas of <em>value</em> and <em>density</em>. Marketing trends tell us the two are synonymous. I think the difference is subtle, but its implications are far-reaching.</p>
<p>Just because McDonalds offers more beef per dollar does not make it the better value. Simply because one person can quote a project at a lower number does not make them the better value. In a program, more features for less money does not always equate to a better value.</p>
<p>Too often, we view value as <em>quantity &divide; cost</em>, or density.</p>
<h3>A better way</h3>
<p>Sure, quantitative value is simple, but it's short-sighted. We should actually be calculating <em>quality &divide; cost</em>. Quality is messy. It's inexact. It's <strong>not</strong> quantity. So too often we default to quantity.</p>
<p>Quality is how the new car purchase will hold up in ten years. It's about asking yourself what your goals and values are, then determining whether a purchase leads you towards said goals and values.</p>
<p>Quantitive value only involves a cursory understanding of the product. Qualitive value involves a meticulous understand of yourself.</p>

    		<p>By now, you've surely heard of <a href="http://clientsfromhell.tumblr.com/">Clients From Hell</a>. If not, go ahead and read some of the stories, then come back here.</p>
<p>At first glance, it's funny. You might laugh for awhile as you flip through the stories. But at some point, you should likely come to the following question: <strong>Why are these designers so arrogant and condescending towards their clients?</strong></p>
<h3>I'll tell you why</h3>
<p>Clients generally don't understand the web. They don't know well enough to know that giving away a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-5D-Mark-II/dp/B001G5ZTLS">Canon 5D Mark II</a> is a good way to get traffic on Twitter. And they don't know well enough to know that this traffic is cheap and won't get them anywhere in the long run. They just did a complete 360-degree turn without knowing it happened.</p>
<p>The things they're asking for&mdash;dogs chasing the cursor on a screen, seventeen different fonts on a page, MySpace sites for kids aged 1-5&mdash;aren't indicative of the fact that they're glaring idiots. (Some exceptions naturally apply.) They're indicative of people coming to you, trustingly, to help them in a medium they don't understand. They're looking to command attention in a space where they're not sure how to achieve that goal.</p>
<h3>The real problem</h3>
<p>So here's a little nugget of information for designers, myself included from time to time: <strong>The problem isn't that your clients are complete morons, the problem is that you're a complete asshole.</strong></p>
<p>Treat your clients as humans&mdash;humans that you can help. They have dreams and goals and aspirations, and they're asking for you to partner with them, to help them in this world of 0s and 1s and usability and standards and nerds. A world they don't understand, but you do.</p>
<p>The real issue is that, for whatever reasons, designers tend to feel we're part of some select aristocracy, doing the masses a service by relating with them. We're short-tempered, impatient, unhelpful, and condescending. Not all, and not always. But many, and often.</p>
<p>And rather than trying to kindly help those who don't understand, we scuttle off to our cyber-nerd-rooms to make them the punch line of our jokes. Real easy to say when you hide behind your IP address or avatar, isn't it?</p>
<h3>A simple manifesto</h3>
<p>Whether I'm designing, dreaming, planning, chatting or other-ing&mdash;online or off, I'll treat others like they're real, human people. People who deserve love and respect. And I hope you'll do the same.<sup id="2010_01_09_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_09_fn2">1</a></sup></p>

    <p>The main reason why — to the amazement of many of my colleagues — TV is still such a tremendously popular medium is that no web site beats the speed of the remote control. No screen design can match the high drive of flipping through physical paper. The same can be said for radios. It’s just simpler to switch on the radio and scroll through stations than preparing your iPod. In terms of speed, traditional interfaces are still the benchmark for web designers.</p>
    <p>People started using Twitter and Facebook for direct messages instead of E-mail because they require less physical manipulations to send a message. Future web designers will focus less on surface design but on speeding up processes by cutting reducing physical manipulations. The best way to learn about speedy interfaces is to study everyday interfaces as doorknobs, drawers, shampoo bottles. Web designers need to learn more from traditional product designers.</p>

    		<p>Google Voice is pretty exciting in theory. One number to rule them all, archived and searchable SMS, voicemails stored as text, recording conversations, different rules for different contact groups. You've got to admit, those are some incredible features.</p>
<p>One of it's hilarious downfalls, however, is its inadequate transcription mechanism. I don't know of any better services out there, and it might be a lost cause, but Google Voice gives you some hilariously bad transcripts of voicemails.</p>
<p>Here are my three favorites, and I'd love to hear any bad experiences you have in the comments:</p>

    		<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Here be nerdery and hackery that will be more valuable to future Googlers than most who would occasionally read these thoughts. Also, a Mac and <a href="http://panic.com/transmit">Transmit</a> by Panic are here used.<sup id="2010_01_02_fnlink1"><a href="#2010_01_02_fn1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Recently, Jeff Atwood <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001315.html">ran into a problem</a>. His site, Coding Horror, suffered a catastrophic and complete data loss. Everything was lost&mdash;entries, photos, databases, you name it. For anyone who runs a site, this is a problem. He was able to recover most of his data from loyal readers, Google's cache, and his own, sparse backups.</p>
<p>But most of us don't have the benefit of devout followers making backups of our sites so they can read them offline, print copies to line their mattress with and save us in case of an emergency. So this is what I do, server side<sup id="2010_01_02_fnlink2"><a href="#2010_01_02_fn2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Set up two folders at the root (one level above the document root, which is likely public_html) of my server: one for database backups and the other for entire site backups.</li>
    <li>Create two files at the root of my server: one with a script <a href="http://tips-scripts.com/site_backups">to back up my site</a> and another with a <a href="http://tips-scripts.com/sql_backups">script to back up my databases</a>.</li>
    <li>Run each of these via cron (so they'll run on their own, once per day, at a specified time) at odd times during off-peak hours&mdash;say, the first at 2:37am and the second at 3:06am.</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we've got a compressed file in the format of /backup/daynumber.tar.gz (i.e. /backup/30.tar.gz or /backup/14.tar.gz). So naturally, as we circle around to a new month, files are overwritten to save space. So you've got 30 days of backups for your entire site and for your databases, right there. But they're still on the server, which is vulnerable to spilled soup, mean people and the terrorists. So let's move them local.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create two folders on my personal computer: one for database backups and the other for entire site backups. (Sound familiar?)</li>
    <li>Create a Transmit favorite to connect directly to each of the folders on your server, and name them something simple. ("DB Backups" and "Site Backups" for me.)</li>
    <li>Fire up Automator, and in Library &gt; Internet, choose "Synchronize Files" next to the little Transmit icon.</li>
    <li>Choose my Transmit favorite of database backups, set the sync direction to "Download," sync method to "Update," and the appropriate local folder as my "Local path."</li>
    <li>Save the workflow as a file somewhere memorable and repeat the process for entire site backups.</li>
    <li>Create a new iCal event with an alarm sometime <em>after</em> your daily server backup mentioned above.</li>
    <li>For the alarm action, choose "Open file," and select your Automator workflow for database backups. Create a second event and alarm for entire site backups.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, in 10 rather convoluted and confusing steps, you'll have an email alert each morning to let you know if you backed up successfully. I also changed the subject of the email it sends me to let me know whether it succeeded or failed, and I have Gmail automatically archive successes so only failures get through to my inbox.</p>
<p>So that's that. I'll open comments on this article as well so anyone can add, subtract or call me an idiot. Oh, also, I'd love to hear anything different you're doing with other setups.</p>
<ol>
	<li id="2010_01_02_fn1">Here is my setup: a <a href="http://site5.com">site5</a> server with PHP5 and a MySQL database. And locally, an iMac running Snow Leopard that stays on 24/7, backs up via Time Machine. Also, Automator (which you have if you're following so far) and Transmit. I don't know enough to know if your mileage will vary, so plan accordingly. <a href="#2010_01_02_fnlink2" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>
	<li id="2010_01_02_fn2">I'm extremely happy with site5 and trust them tremendously. But I do want myself, not them, to be accountable for things that belong to me&mdash;in this case, intellectual property. <a href="#2010_01_02_fnlink2" class="small_caps">&nbsp;&nbsp;[Jump back]</a></li>

    		<p>Great leaders are grateful. Some of the men and women in my life (many without any online presence to link to, so this certainly isn't a technological point) who have influenced me the most share a common characteristic: <strong>they're incredibly gracious and appreciative.</strong> They affirm. They give. They thank.</p>
<p>But why?</p>
<p>Great leaders appreciate the investment of others, which helped them get where they are. They're not hopelessly nostalgic, but they're insightful enough to know they couldn't have gotten here alone. They're grateful for the muses on their journey. Great leaders are also famously prescient. They understand what's coming, and they're grateful for those that will help them get there.</p>
<p>But more than anything, great leaders understand people. Before delivering a new product, moving a non-profit towards viability, or beginning a new venture, they understand humanity&mdash;needs, desires, feelings. Understanding those things, they deliver products or services that meet needs or desires, and the most successful leaders deliver experiences with positive feelings. The truly astute know their co-laborers, peers, superiors, and team members have the same needs, desires, and feelings as their consumers. And they know their praise, in whatever form it comes, fuels them towards a common mission.</p>
<p>And when you grasp that, this naturally follows: <strong>in the long term, unless you're grateful, you'll never be successful.</strong></p>

    		<p class="note"><span class="small_caps">Editor's Note: </span>Somehow I missed that I originally posted this as <em>5 Albums to Remember From the 90s</em>. The error was sever, and we at joshuacody.net extend our most sincere apologies. And a tip o' the hat to <a href="http://twitter.com/jeff_goins">Jeff Goins</a> for the help.</p>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://mrgan.tumblr.com/post/304714649/favorite-music-2000s">Neven Mrgan</a> and <a href="http://armstrongcircus.com/blog/840/">Paul Armstrong</a> have both posted their best-of-the-decate music lists, and as I'd been thinking of doing my own for awhile, I figured I'd throw my hat in the ring as well. Neven makes a great point:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I don’t trust my brain. Sure, it keeps me vertical most of the time, it tells me when I’m hungry, and I let it take care of the water bill. But ask it what my favorite music of the last decade was, and you’ll get a lot of hogwash comprising a neat mix of popular tunes, obscure concept albums, and hipster honor badges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, I'm not going to go the iTunes most-played route. It's not an accurate representation of what I listened to on various other devices and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compact_Disc">compact discs</a> in the last 10 years. Oh, and bear in mind, I was a 12-year-old when this decade began. It should go without saying that my list will be backloaded, unless you want albums like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tubthumper">Chumbawumba's Tubthumping</a>.</p>
<p>Without further ado, with brief explanations appended, my favorite albums of the aughts.</p>
<h3>Copeland&mdash;Beneath Medicine Tree</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/1657606138229293178/Copeland/Beneath_Medicine_Tree"><img src="/images/blog-img/copeland.jpg" alt="Beneath Medicine Tree" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Written during a particularly grueling period in lead singer Aaron Marsh's life, Beneath Medicine Tree deals extensively with hospitals, pain, and death. But at the end of it all, hope remains. Songs on this album pulled me through both the hospitalization of family members and the angst of late-teen romance. (And when you're a teenager, it's hard to tell which is worse.) Here's one particular verse that served as the anthem for plenty of walks in downtown Atlanta with myself and Caroline:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Through the night
    <br />
    We were waiting for a sign
    <br />
    Maybe rendered in the darkened sky
    <br />  
    Drawn by imaginary lines
    <br />
    Connecting radiant points of light
    <br />
    (please don't go)
    <br />
    Cause you showed up with your hair down
    <br />
    I might not sleep tonight</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The National&mdash;Boxer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/1225260573704657742/The_National/Boxer"><img src="/images/blog-img/national.jpg" alt="Boxer" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>This one wouldn't likely make any other best-of-the-decade lists. Most folks wouldn't even consider it the best album by The National. But, for me, there's something beautiful and dark about "Fake Empire" that reminds me of a very particular season in my life. Even more, standing at a particular place and thinking a particular thing. The tone of the entire album is sheer perfection for a summer night in the city.</p>
<h3>Brand New&mdash;The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/432627039263933890/Brand_New/The_Devil_And_God_Are_Raging_Inside_Me"><img src="/images/blog-img/brandnew.jpg" alt="The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>If you hadn't noticed by the title, this is a difficult album. I'll quote effusively to prove my point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I used to be such a burning example,
<br />
I used to be so original.
<br />
I used to care, I was being cared for.
<br />
Made sure I showed it to those that I love.</p>

<p>I used to sleep without a single stir,
<br />
'Cause I was about my father's work.</p>

<p>Well take me out tonight,
<br />
This ship of fools I'm on will sink.
<br />
A millstone around my neck,
<br />
Be my breath, there's nothing I wouldn't give.</p>

<p>I used to pray like God was listening.
<br />
I used to make my parents proud.
<br />
I was the glue that kept my friends together,
<br />
Now they don't talk and we don't go out.</p>

<p>I used to know the name of every person I'd kissed.
<br />
Now I made this bed and I can't fall asleep in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No album of the decade so powerfully captured the human condition and the problem of evil. It drags you through the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/18/national/main2101044.shtml">death of a seven-year-old girl</a> at the hands of a drunk driver, the loss of innocence, and failed relationships. Even redemption is framed as fear and hopelessness:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I know you're coming in the night like a thief
    <br />
    But I've had some time, O Lord, to hone my lying technique
    <br />
    I know you think that I'm someone you can trust
    <br />
    But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up</p>    
    <p>So do you think that we could work out a sign
    So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, The Devil and God Are Raging Inside of Me reflects life for all of us at some time or another. Certainly not the most enjoyable album of the decade, but definitely the most sobering.</p>
<h3>Explosions in the Sky&mdash;The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/5620773809945212824/Explosions_In_The_Sky/The_Earth_Is_Not_a_Cold_Dead_Place"><img src="/images/blog-img/explosions.jpg" alt="The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>If you know me (no, really know me), then you are aware of my musical shortcomings. If you do not know me, then you should know, I have musical shortcomings. And not just any. We're talking borderline <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amusia">amusia</a> here. So it's no small feat that the entire instrumental <em>The Earth is Not a Cold, Dead Place</em> was able to impress me. I'd love to give more effusive praise for its melody, pitch, instrumentation, and musical perfection, but I'll leave that to people with two fully-functional ears.</p>
<h3>The Decemberists&mdash;Picaresque</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.lala.com/#album/2017894108902068380/The_Decemberists/Picaresque"><img src="/images/blog-img/decemberists.jpg" alt="Picaresque" width="200" height="200" class="center" /></a></p>
<p>Picaresque is a literati's musical dream. It's <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Candide/Voltaire/e/9781593080280/">Candide</a> set to music, the perfect example of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picaresque">picaresque</a>. You'll learn words you never knew you never knew (hat tip to last decade's Pocahontas) and get wrapped up in eleven beautiful acts that make up a nearly-perfect whole. My favorite story of the album climaxes thusly:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Meet me on my vast veranda 
    <br />
    My sweet, untouched Miranda 
    <br />
    And while the seagulls are crying 
    <br />
    We fall but our souls are flying</p></blockquote>
<pre><code>&lt;p&gt;And each of the eleven songs are equally epic and perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Around a year ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/kevinhendricks">Kevin Hendricks</a> posted a simple question on Twitter asking for recommendations of methods to back up your Twitter updates. He wanted an automatic and local solution&mdash;a man wise enough to realize users don't make backups when they have to put thought into it (cf. Apple's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(Apple_software)">Time Machine</a>).</p>
<p>Aptly, I can't find his question today. And since I couldn't find that, <a href="http://joshuacody.net/archive">I built this</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, it cycles through my Twitter updates every 10 minutes, stores any new information in a database, then displays that information in a searchable manner. Nothing too fancy. </p>
<p>But let's talk more about why.</p>
<h3>A slight rant on search and pagination</h3>
<p>Looking for Kevin's year-old update exposes the shortcomings of Twitter's history.</p>
<p>Twitter's <a href="http://search.twitter.com">own search function</a> has only a 10-day memory. Alternately, I could paginate through his last 3200 updates, which they allow access to. Twitter's AJAX pagination, however, makes this experience fall somewhere between a headache and a disaster. The feature [sic] means the page doesn't have to reload when you click "more," but it also means that the URL contains no clue to where in the search results you are.</p>
<p>For example's sake, navigate to a user's page. <a href="http://twitter.com/jpcody">Mine will do just fine</a>. Now say you have hit "more" 100 times, which means a single page holds 2,000 results. But the URL still reads as <em>http://twitter.com/jpcody</em>. And should you navigate away, experience a browser crash, or accidentally hit the "Back" button of your browser, all your clicking and scrolling is lost. When you return to the page, you only get the 20 most recent updates for said user.</p>
<p>Then you cuss, your children hear, they repeat the words at school, and Twitter has landed you back in the principal's office.</p>
<h3>So you built this just to search?</h3>
<p>Not completely, although that's certainly a part of it. It <strong>is</strong> nice to be able to simply search "allanwhite" when I'm looking for something I remember saying to him back in September.</p>
<p>More importantly, I built it because Twitter doesn't exactly have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter#Outages">sparkling track record</a>. Not even <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/12/17/twitter-reportedly-hacked-by-iranian-cyber-army/">within the last week</a>. And I don't trust my data in their hands.</p>
<p>Jeff Atwood recently experienced a nearly entire loss of his site, Coding Horror, and <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001315.html">had this to say in its wake</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Don't rely on your host or anyone else to back up your important data. Do it yourself. If you aren't personally responsible for your own backups, they are effectively not happening.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not to be a doomsayer, but Twitter could die. It's part of life for any service, bird, or application. There are malicious people out there with fast computers and an appetite for destruction. There are also brain farts, server errors, and lacks in foresight. It's just life on the internet.</p>
<p>Least of all, it's fun to be able to easily navigate to <a href="http://joshuacody.net/archive/index.php/archives/index/2450">my first musings</a> and see what I was saying back then. At this point, I haven't hit the magical number of 3200, so I could retrieve all of my updates (and still link to them on Twitter, should I choose). And now, my first 3200 will be stored on my own server, so even when I pass this upper-limit, I'll be able to access them at <em>http://joshuacody.net/twitter</em>.</p>
<p>(And, my server space and databases are backed up nightly to my personal machine, which is backed up to rotating hard drives, so I can really, really keep my data.)</p>
<h3>All this for some stupid Twitter updates?</h3>
<p>Yes, with a caveat.</p>
<p>Most people are guilty of a hasty generalization with Twitter. It's still commonly assumed that it's a place to "type what you ate for breakfast." (This fallacy comes in other packages as well, but it's the one tossed about most often.)</p>
<p>But I don't view it as such.</p>
<p class="big_quote">Twitter is a big corner of my online life where I store drafts of ideas, links to things I love, and snapshots of moments in time.</p>
<p>It's where I've learned the most about editing, the power of brevity, and the real-world value of sharing information. I can look back through my corner and see where I was a year ago&mdash;the things I was linking to, the way I was writing, or the pictures I was uploading. I can see where I was wrong and what I would do differently. And yeah, I've even said things that, to me, were wise enough or clever enough to keep.</p>
<h3>The future</h3>
<p>I'm thinking and brainstorming of ways to make this available to other folks. If it's something that'd be useful to you, then please follow me and retweet the following message:</p>
<p>I'm kidding. But let me know on Twitter or via email, and if it's something enough folks are interested in, I'll put some time and effort there.</p>

    		<p>As an enduring nostalgist, this <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/17/the-referendum/">New York Times Piece</a> affected me deeply. Tim Krieder examines middle-age and its accompanying feelings of helplessness. I read a lot of myself here, from his comically poignant views on children:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Most of my married friends now have children, the rewards of which appear to be exclusively intangible and, like the mysteries of some gnostic sect, incommunicable to outsiders. In fact it seems from the outside as if these people have joined a dubious cult: they claim to be much happier and more fulfilled than ever before, even though they live in conditions of appalling filth and degradation, deprived of the most basic freedoms and dignity, and owe unquestioning obedience to a capricious and demented master.</p>
    <p>I have never even idly thought for a single passing second that it might make my life nicer to have a small, rude, incontinent person follow me around screaming and making me buy them stuff for the rest of my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to his deeply sobering thoughts on eternity and reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The problem is, we only get one chance at this, with no do-overs. Life is, in effect, a non-repeatable experiment with no control. In his novel about marriage, “Light Years,” James Salter writes: “For whatever we do, even whatever we do not do prevents us from doing its opposite. Acts demolish their alternatives, that is the paradox.” Watching our peers’ lives is the closest we can come to a glimpse of the parallel universes in which we didn’t ruin that relationship years ago, or got that job we applied for, or got on that plane after all. It’s tempting to read other people’s lives as cautionary fables or repudiations of our own.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pursuing the delicate balance of judicious reflection and healthy perspective is difficult at best. My failures at achieving peace make me thankful and hopeful that, while we get no do-overs, this life is only the prelude. And it doesn't quite feel like home and peace and comfort and perfection because it's <em>not</em>. That's the hope that keeps the troubles of the world at bay.</p>

    		<p>You'll surely find yourself more fulfilled by <a href="http://evhead.com/2009/11/why-retweet-works-way-it-does.html">Evan Williams' explanation</a> than my own. Read on at your own peril.</p>
<h3>A quick primer on a new feature</h3>
<p>Twitter recently implemented a new "retweet" feature. They've created a system where a User A can click "retweet" when viewing User B's message. Then, all who follow User A will see User B's status update in their own timelines, displayed thusly:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/2009-11-18-retweet.jpg" width="420" height="59" class="center" /></p>
<p>So you get:</p>
<ul>
    <li>An unknown avatar</li>
    <li>A little icon (that feels pretty out-of-place to Twitter's aesthetic)</li>
    <li>A line break plus appended, "Retweeted by [user]"</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pitchforks are ready, and heads must roll</h3>
<p>This is true of mostly any major feature change. And I don't think the complainers are without reason. Here are some of the leading arguments against the new feature (partially drawn from <a href="http://outspokenmedia.com/social-media/twitters-new-retweet-feature-sucks/">this post</a> and partially from various other arguments aggregated over time):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Who is this person in my stream?!</li>
    <li>But I want to add some context!</li>
    <li>People should know it came from <strong>me</strong>!</li>
    <li>What was wrong with the way it was?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Whoa, guys! Wait a second!</h3>
<p>I should begin by saying I am not a big fan of "retweeting." Occasionally, it's certainly warranted, but for some folks, it's like Twitter crack. They just can't stop. Come up with something to say of your own, and if someone else has enough good things to say, suggest to your Twitter crowd that they follow that person.</p>
<p>That being said, let's take a look at some of the arguments against the new implementation, and let's work last to first.</p>
<p>Lots of folks are missing the way it was, which is all right. But creating an official protocol for this function allows for all sorts of applications—mobile, web, and desktop—to access it via the API and creates a more uniform experience for Twitter users. Additionally, redundancy issues abound. In the search feature, you can end up with the whole search query filled by messages prepended with "RT @username", and in your own timeline, five people might post the same update. And some people thought it'd be fun to take a crap in the sandbox. They figured out they could have people follow them, retweet some message a thousand times and win a neat prize. They got high-volume, low-value followers and empty mentions, and we got a broken Twitter.</p>
<p>It's hard to argue against native support. Many people would give me this point, but they're still up in arms about the implementation.</p>
<p>The loudest grumbles come in the form of users complaining that strangers are popping up in their timeline, and this offends on two fronts: the first, it is confusing, and the second, it's not immediately obvious who second-hand shared the update. I think this could definitely be done a little bit better. A mockup of one thing I think would improve the system is below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog-img/retweet2.jpg" width="420" height="164" class="center" />
&lt;p class="image_caption"&gt;This would use the <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%40jpcody">search-style reply images</a> to display who did the retweeting.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>I'd find this a bit of an improvement, <strong>but I do think the current, official system is better than the old system.</strong> The way things were, credit for the original poster was little-to-none. A small text-link that was subconsciously dismissed due to the prepended "RT @." Individuals coming up with content worth being shared deserve more credit than this. They deserve for their original content to be seen in its original format—next to their avatar, prepended by their username.</p>
<p>In unofficial retweet syntax, all of the credit goes to the one who re-posted the original message. And that's not right. (I will reiterate that I realize the original poster received a text link, but due to the frequency of the syntax, most of the time I found myself subliminally discarding this opening information.)</p>
<p>But, wait! You want to add context, too! Thus, you get about six thousand of these in your timeline as people look at add "context" and keep it under 140 characters:</p>
<p class="big_quote">RT @username blah blah blah blah blah // WOW! lolzzz!</p>
<p class="center">&mdash;or&mdash;</p>
<p class="big_quote">RT @username I wnt 2 th str &amp; thnk I sw Jn Gsslin frm Jn&amp;Kt+8! | kewl!</p>
<p>This isn't always the case, and sometimes people can add great context with limited characters. But do you want to really add context? Begin your message with "re: http://j.mp/link", linking to the original post and having 120 characters for <strong>real, thorough</strong> context.</p>
<h3>C'mon, put the pitchfork down.</h3>
<p>It's certainly not perfect, and the implementation has a ways to go. But it's a heck of a lot better than the old madness.</p>
<p>I haven't covered all of the complaints, and perhaps I've missed some glaring ones, but I think proper attribution and minimizing redundancy can trump any argument I could imagine.</p>
<p>My biggest complaint? It's not very easy to mute a compulsive retweeter. It's possible without <em>too</em> much clicking around, but it's certainly not readily obvious.</p>
<p>And I certainly plan to use it for those using the new feature gratuitously.</p>

<p>&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;</p>
<p>Simply put, it's the best movie I've seen this year. Brilliantly written, directed, and designed, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0887912/">The Hurt Locker</a> strikes the perfect blend of pure adrenaline and introspection. It's a far cry from the feeble-minded and heavy-handed attempts to demonize or glorify the Iraq War, opting to take an honest look at the psychological effects—good, bad, and necessary—of modern warfare.</p>
<p>The story follows Sergeant William James (played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Renner">Jeremy Renner</a>) through his tour in Iraq as a member of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal unit. He's sharp-witted, loyal, courageous, reckless, and everything in between, and Renner's performance captures his complexity perfectly—a refreshing break from the flat characters of so many war movies. Sergeant James focuses on neither past nor future; instead, he spends the movie being, and director <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathryn_Bigelow">Kathryn Bigelow</a> slowly reveals his depth. This is the crux of the entire movie, and the plot serves only to slowly disclose James to us, and in turn, the difficult lives of men like him. (And the possibly more difficult lives of those surrounding them.)</p>
<p>For me, its only shortcoming was sloppy and forced dialogue in a small handful of scenes. This was nothing more than a blip on the radar. Nitpicking.</p>
<p>All in all, the movie riveted me for 128 minutes, and I left exhausted and contemplative. You can't merely watch <em>The Hurt Locker</em>, looking for escape or a catharsis. You participate in it, and you leave thankful for those you love and deeply concerned about the flawed human condition.</p>

    		<p><a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a> bills itself as "antisocial bookmarking." By default, all your bookmarks are private, it doesn't have a design worth sharing (it's not dissimilar from <a href="http://wrongtomorrow.com/">Wrong Tomorrow</a>, another site by Maciej Ceglowski) and built-in sharing features are pretty minimal. Oh, and it's not free. That brings forward one big question: <strong>What's so great about Pinboard?</strong></p>
<h3>Speed</h3>
<p>When you visit the page, three elements are given obvious visual precedence: the brand, the main navigation, and the time it took for the page to load. The current page I'm on? 0.044 seconds, or 44 milliseconds. So what's the difference between .044 seconds and one second? And why would a company make this their third most-weighted design element?</p>
<p>One study, from The Human Oriented Technology Lab suggests that your visitors <a href="http://www.carleton.ca/hotlab/Abstracts/LindgaardG.FernandesG.Dud.html">judge your site in 50 milliseconds</a>, or 1/20th of a second. Obviously, visitors aren't leaving your site if you're not ready within that 50 millisecond threshold, and this is only one study. But it does show the importance of speed and time—revealing that we have less time than we think to impress.</p>
<p>Prefer to speak revenue? BlinkList.com made an improvement of a few milliseconds, and they saw their <a href="http://blog.mindvalleylabs.com/gone-in-4-seconds-why-your-page-load-speed-matters/176/">revenue jump 25%</a>. Speed matters.</p>
<p><a href="/images/blog-img/2009-07-17-pinboardbig.jpg" class="image group"><img src="/images/blog-img/2009-07-17-pinboardsmall.jpg" alt="Pinboard" class="center" /></a></p>
<h3>The Cost</h3>
<p>I'm not sure exactly how Pinboard got their idea for what to charge for their service (Although some insight is given. It was apparently conceived by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Schachter">Joshua Schachter</a>, previously of Del.icio.us, but I may be interpreting <a href="http://twitter.com/PinboardIN/statuses/2629590295">this Twitter update</a> incorrectly.), but here is how it breaks down: total number of users * $.001 is what you pay . As of now, it's $4.84, which means 4,84[0-9] people have signed up for the service, if I'm correct. I believe the average amount they have paid is half of $4.84, which would be $2.42, which is around $11,724 for the developer. That's a pretty good boost towards development. But a rich developer isn't the only reason charging like this is such a great idea.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It slows growth. Some services grow too fast, and they just can't handle the server loads and difficulties of a growing business. Twitter was a good example of this, although they seem to have made it through their growing pains.</li>
    <li>It values early adopters. It makes the barrier of entry lower for the people who are likely to give better feedback, be more involved and spread the word about your product.</li>
    <li>It discourages unintended use. <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/">Ask Metafilter</a> charges users a $5 one-time signup fee, and it's mostly a spam-free thriving community. It's amazing what a small barrier-to-entry can do to zap a spambot.</li>
    <li>It keeps out advertising. I place a lot of value on my attention, and if I can shave seconds and manage my focus more effectively, I'll gladly drop a few bones to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, this small fee provides a boost to development and will make Pinboard a vastly improved product. It's surprising to me the number of people who won't pay a fee of less than a fast food meal for an application, program, or service that they'll use day-in and day-out. This is pretty essential capitalism—if something is worth it, then pay for it. The world will be a better place for it.</p>
<h3>And A Little More</h3>
<p>Speed is undoubtedly the most important interface priority, but beyond that, there are a few other niceties. Clean URLs, AJAX goodness and pure simplicity make the interface a pleasure.</p>
<p>Outside of the visual interface, the idea of implementing a "to read" permatag is great. So often I want to mark something to read later, and it just permeates my bookmarks indefinitely.</p>
<p>And don't miss out on the copywriting. It's pithy, clever, and wonderful&mdash;complete with little shots at <a href="http://corvusconsulting.ca/2009/02/ma-gnolias-bad-day/">Ma.gnolia</a> and Del.icio.us, if you can find them. The features roadmap is insightful, and the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pinboard-dev/">developer group</a> is responsive and helpful.</p>
<h3>But It's Not All Peachy</h3>
<p>It's certainly a new service, and it shows in their interface. Some things are nonsensical or lacking as far as what you'd hope in using the service.That said, here are my gripes, mostly interface-related, as I feel the feature set is pretty satisfactory:</p>
<ul>
    <li>There's no way to toggle views between private and public items. And the private/public delineator next to your username is disconnected from any context to suggest meaning.</li>
    <li>Bulk editing is weak at best, handled only by the burdensome process of bulk starring, loading a new page, and then editing. Tons of room for improvement here.</li>
    <li>Settings are pretty text-heavy. The majority of the information is irrelevant to to the average user and could be revealed only when necessary, but I'm nitpicking here.</li>
    <li>Hover behavior needs a little attention. When hovering on a star, you get a cursor rather than pointer, and when hovering on any other link, you get nothing. This would make a big difference in usability.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I'd give the service a heavy recommendation. And you can check out <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:jpcody/">my bookmarks</a> on your way to signing up.</p>

    		<p>I hail from near Atlanta, with its bastard-child MARTA. I've spent a summer in Los Angeles, the paragon of terrible public transportation. I feel I have the experience necessary to say that New York's public transportation system is absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>My wife and I, when we were dating, had the benefit of being the progeny or Delta employees, so skipping school looked like this from time-to-time: We would wake up before the sun to head to the airport. We'd catch the first flight of the day to New York City. Upon arrival, we'd hope the bus to the north end of Manhattan, then take the subway to the heart of the city. After exploring the city all day, we'd reverse our route and catch the last flight home that night. And it was all made possible by a well-thought and well-designed transit system.</p>
<p>It looks like that's about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/nyregion/24naming.html">to get more difficult</a> as the MTA tries to sell the naming rights to the Atlantic Avenue station to Barclays of London.</p>
<p>Some corporate entities already have stops named after them, but Jason Kottke, almost as an afterthought, <a href="http://www.kottke.org/09/06/mta-selling-subway-station-naming-rights">makes a very valid point</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But, without exception, station names are derived from nearby landmarks: streets, airports, schools, stadiums, squares, parks, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He's spot-on. This is a precedent well-ingrained in the minds of frequent visitors and residents of New York City. You'd like to go to Rockefeller Center? The World Trade Center? Broadway? Oh, all right, there's a subway stop for that. You'd like to go to Barclays? Sure, head to the Barclays stop in Brooklyn, then either recalibrate and head to the financial district in Manhattan, or hail a cab, head to JFK and fly to London. See the problem here? For over a hundred years, the transit system has <em>just made sense</em>. And, especially for the casual visitor, mnemonic stop names are extremely important.</p>
<p>Another issue, albeit with far less financial incentive, is historically motivated. There's something thrilling about seeing names like Atlantic Avenue, Broadway, Canal Street, and 23rd Street go whizzing by. These stops are as iconic as Route 66, Wrigley Field, or Norman Rockwell. It will be sad to see them go <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Hate-corporate-stadium-names-Use-this-program?urn=mlb,69167">the way of the sports stadium</a>.</p>
<p>And this is a perfect context to send you away to check out <a href="http://designnotes.info/?p=1805">this little piece of design idiocy</a>, also presented to you by the MTA.</p>

<p>I've got a minor fascination with street art and the subversive in general. It's for that reason that I was struck by <a href="http://www.woostercollective.com/2009/06/barrel_monsters.html">this barrel monster</a> created by an NC State University student. It's a bummer that he was arrested, but I imagine street art wouldn't be nearly as fun if it were legalized.</p>

    		<p>Recently, I had the misfortune of reading <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1899804,00.html">What Will the World Do With More Search Engines?</a>, an online article from <em>Time Magazine</em>, written by Douglas A. McIntyre. I bookmarked it, feeling something should be done or said about the state of journalism online. A couple weeks later, this is both the time and place for that. In order for you to get the full effect of my commentary, as well as for a good laugh, you should go ahead and <a href="http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1899804,00.html">read the article</a>. I'll wait here.</p>
<h3>Done? Great. Let's continue...</h3>
<p>I considered going line-by-line at this article. But honestly, we'd be here for far, far too long. And if you had the patience for reading something longer, you'd have your nose in a literary magazine or, you know, a book. So let's look at a few quick problems that are indicative of one larger problem.</p>
<p><strong>The style.</strong> It's journalism. You don't need to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_Wallace">David Foster Wallace</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_safran_foer">Jonathan Safran Foer</a>. But you're paid not to be a complete bore. This article's first three sentences read with the same rhythm as my near-deaf grandmother trying to find the right clapping cadence to <em>Amazing Grace</em>. It didn't get better. By the end of the article, it had all the smoothness of a case of the hiccups in the middle of a seizure.</p>
<p><strong>The research.</strong> All right, last time I said, "It's journalism." But I'm not totally convinced of that. The article dismissively explains the marketing strategies of Google's smaller search engine competitors and slips in the faux-statistic that there are 500,000 "search products" available&mdash; all in three sentences. If you listen closely, you can hear McIntyre saying "Ah, screw it." before he laments, "That figure seems high, but it is impossible to disprove." regarding the latter statistic. Overall, there's not a morsel of interesting journalism in the entire piece.</p>
<p><strong>The banalities.</strong> Wow, they really slip some stinkers in there. Exhibit A: "Loyalty is not always a by-product of function, though function often creates loyalty." Exhibit B: "Good is so excellent that it is not good anymore." I rest my case. Not that the insights are, well, insightful in the first place, but the way they are stated makes me feel like I've heard them my entire life. Apparently Mr. McIntyre didn't get the memo that BS at least needs to be <em>interesting to read</em>.</p>
<p>And although it doesn't necessarily fit in any above category, I would be remiss not to mention what goes down in paragraph six. Without any transition whatsoever, McIntyre takes us from discussing search engines, into a metaphor of airplane altitude, then to discussing chip manufacturers. I do have to give credit for finding the perfect climax to the absurdity that came before. It almost felt <strong>right</strong> just how little sense this made.</p>
<h3>Here's the rub.</h3>
<p>I'm not faulting Douglas A. McIntyre for the broad gap between the respectability of his name and his writing. I trust he is a better writer than he showed in this article, quite frankly, because I don't believe it's possible to be paid for writing so poorly. I'm faulting <em>Time</em>.</p>
<p>Like so many of the other print dinosaurs, they just don't get it. They still think that the internet is made of a bunch of fat kids sitting in their parents' basements eating salt and vinegar potato chips. Somewhere in their system of hiring, vetting, editing, and publishing, they said these words: "It's all right. It's just the internet." And they hit "publish" on a big, steaming pile of crap.</p>
<p>So here's a bit of advice for you, <em>Time</em>. Other endangered corporations, you can listen as well. <strong>Just because it's the internet, doesn't mean it can suck.</strong> If anything, it has to suck less. If you wouldn't publish it in print, don't publish it online. If you would publish it in print, consider publishing it online, but only if it fits. I know you're not as stupid as you're acting, so please. Just stop.</p>

    		<p>John Siracusa of Ars Technica recently wrote <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars">Hypercritical</a>, an insightful look into the mind of those who were born to critique. It's a skill that I'm trying to develop more each day, but John is just on a whole different level. Don't trust me? Read his <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2007/10/mac-os-x-10-5.ars">17-page review of Mac OS X Leopard</a>.</p>
<p>To take a single quote from his look at those who are hypercritical is a great injustice, but I'll do it anyways. But only after you promise to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/staff/fatbits/2009/05/hypercritical.ars">read the whole article</a>. Promise? Cross your heart? Cross it. OK.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>The point is, ladies and gentleman, that criticism, for lack of a better word, is good. Criticism is right. Criticism works. Criticism clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit…</p>
    <p>Okay, let me try that again. Actually, I'm on the same page as Gordon Gekko in one important respect. Like greed, criticism gets a bad rap, especially when it's presented in large doses. It's impolite. It's unnecessarily obsessive. It's just a bummer. But the truth is, precious little in life gets fixed in the absence of a good understanding of what's wrong with it to begin with.</p>

    		<p>There's pretty much only one person I listen to when it comes to Apple predictions. Jon Gruber of <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>. And here's a bit of what he has to say about new iPhones tomorrow:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>I expect Apple to announce updated iPhones with significantly faster processors, twice the RAM, and twice the storage. I expected prices to remain the same as the current lineup: $199/299 for 16/32 GB, respectively. The video camera is going to be a major selling point.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also says that his hunch is that iPhone 3 will carry the moniker <em>iPhone 3GS</em>. I call shenanigans here. It's been a long, long time since Apple has used any sort of acronym system in their naming. Nor do they append letters for the heck of it in the mold of PCs or luxury cars. My money is on leaving the iPhone 3G as a lower entry-point and adding the iPhone 3G Video. But tomorrow will tell.</p>
<p>And Gruber has bad news regarding Snow Leopard:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>But while I am convinced that “Marble” [a potential new OS X user interface] is a real design project at Apple, I no longer believe it is slated for Snow Leopard. A new visual appearance isn’t something Apple can spring on third-party developers at the last moment. If they plan to ship Snow Leopard soon — say, by the end of August — that just isn’t enough time to allow developers to update their software to look good under a new UI theme.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sad news. He's got even more details, so make sure to <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/06/wwdc_2009_predictions">read his article</a>.</p>

    		<p>Things here are still being worked out. I've never had a personal site before, and naturally, rather than getting hooked into Blogger, Wordpress, etc., I decided to learn HTML, CSS, Expression Engine, and a little bit of server-side scripting to roll my own. I ended up liking it enough that I'd like to pursue the creation of hypertext professionally.</p>
<p>One thing that truly amazed me is the difficulty of a personal site, compared with some of the other sites I've worked on. I was aghast at how little I know about myself and how difficult it is to make decisions based on one's own personality. I tried brainstorming, doodling, mood boards, and about everything I could think of. I still don't feel like I came up with a site that accurately portrays either how I view myself or how I would like to be viewed. One thing I'm incredibly grateful for through this entire process is the rabbit hole I've been taken down in understanding who I am and what that means through this site. Hopefully version two will present that more clearly.</p>
<p>For now, I thought I'd archive some notes on the design.</p>
<h3>How I Got This Far</h3>
<p>I think some inspiration here would be duly noted. Although the <a href="http://joshuacody.net/thanks">thanks page</a> is also a good place to check out. For various reasons, this site looks almost nothing like any of the sites I'm about to list:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://seansperte.com/">Geek &amp; Mild</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://typesites.com/">Typesites</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/">Jason Santa Maria</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.chrisglass.com/">Chris Glass</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://joshuablankenship.com/">Joshua Blankenship</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>What I particularly like</h3>
<p>I'm pretty pleased with how the texturing came out and the small patch I was able to use and get a decent effect repeating using CSS. Structurally, I think I've also pretty much nailed things down exactly how I want them. I'd like to explain a few of the decisions I made in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>[Page Name].joshuacody.net.</strong> I think this is the simplest URL structure. When telling someone something, it's much easier to say "blank dot blank dot net" than "blank dot net backslash blank." I would, however, like to publicly tirade the squatter at joshuacody.com for messing up my user experience.</p>
<p><strong>The things I love.</strong> I've always known I'd like to include this. I'm fascinated in interviews centering around the things people love and use, and it's why I'm eagerly awaiting <a href="http://bbbbrands.com/">bbbbrands.com</a>. I develop extreme loyalty to the things I own that treat me well, and I feel like I'd love to share that with you. I'm particularly pleased with the way this section turned out.</p>
<p><strong>The footer.</strong> For quite awhile, I struggled over what to put in here. I think this came to be a perfect balance as I now have a contact form on every single page, easy navigation and some other places you can find me on the web. There isn't anything else I wish was in there, and there isn't anything I feel shouldn't be there. I didn't want to embed my Flickr stream or Twitter posts on the site, because if you wanted to be regularly updated on those, you would likely be visiting them individually, not here.</p>
<p><strong>The blog as home.</strong> Content is king. I truly and honestly believe this. Design exists to make content a pleasure and help an individual or organization tell their stories. I'm glad it takes zero clicks to get to the meat of my content, and there is minimal distraction between the top of the page and the content. This will become even more evident in redesigns.</p>
<p><strong>Expression Engine.</strong> Love it. Enough said.</p>
<h3>The things you might be wondering about</h3>
<p><strong>Where are the comments?</strong> I don't think blog comments are helpful. If you'd like to make your opinion known to all, I'd like to encourage you to write a thoughtful, detailed summary and post it to a location of your choosing. If you'd like to make your opinion known to me, I'd like to encourage you to write a thoughtful, detailed summary and send it through the contact form. When reading an entry, you are choosing to consume the content. After you consume the content, you have some more options:
* Forget it.
* Consider it, and internalize it for the sake of later use.
* Consider it, and disagree with it.
* Consider it, and pass it on.
I don't believe giving you the option to comment on a post is actually helpful. But should you post a thoughtful response elsewhere or send me a thoughtful response with permission to reprint, I will make it a point to update entries.</p>
<p><strong>The navigation is in a strange place.</strong> This was a decision I struggled through. I wanted as little as possible between the top of the page and the content. I decided to use the <a href="http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/10/jquerylocalscroll-10.html">.localscroll jquery plugin</a> to get you from "and more" to the navigation. Even what I have now is a bit much for me, and I hope for version two of the site to adequately address this problem and leave the least possible clutter between page-top and content-top.</p>
<h3>Some Problems</h3>
<p>It's certainly not perfect. I've actually been fiddling with this for probably seven months now, and I just had to get something out the door. I had to convince myself I could go to production, even if it's something I'm not 100% satisfied with. I hope to be and always remain my greatest critic, and I'm on a great start to that here.</p>
<p><strong>The copy.</strong> This goes back to my previous struggles over understanding me. Do I want to be self-aggrandizing? Self-deprecating? Playful? Exciting? This is a personal branding issue&mdash;excuse me, had to get the bile out of my mouth after seriously referring to "personal branding"&mdash;that is bound to send me to the looney bin before I come up with a good answer to it. I feel I need some sort of personality test or an interview from someone who is not me in order to figure this out. I get into ridiculous internal dialogues involving words like actuality, reality, pastiche, and simulacrum, then I find myself <a href="http://twitter.com/lonelysandwich/status/1092663217">disappearing from photographs</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The colors.</strong> Black, brown and bland all over. That will change later.</p>
<p><strong>The type.</strong> I'm not satisfied with my choice of Lucida Grande/Sans Unicode. I haven't thoroughly tested it, but I don't think it's the best cross-browser, cross-platform experience, and I think it's more suited to a technology blog than this humble amalgamation I have here. It also does not work well with the use of Clarendon in the header and footer titles. Again, this will be fixed later.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Version two is already in the works, even before version one is done. A radical stylistic departure from the current version is to be expected. It kind of pisses me off knowing that version one is out in the wild like this, an experiment gone wrong. But hey, that's life. Public design is awkwardly and unexpectedly vulnerable.</p>
