<p>In this seminal work on typography, Robert Bringhurst examines the basics of typography, the relationship between type and math’s fundamental principles, and everything in between. Expect to be educated on both the “how” and “why” of proper typographic style. If you’re a person who designs for a living, this should be required reading. And if you’re simply someone who interacts with type on a daily basis or a person who loves to understand, you’ll find this book a pleasure.</p>
