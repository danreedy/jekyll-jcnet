<p>I only keep a few things on me, so it was silly to carry a scoliosis-inducing booster seat wallet. For years, I’ve been using a <a href="http://images.google.com/images?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=binder%20clip&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;hl=en&amp;tab=wi">binder clip</a> to keep my stuff together. It worked well, apart from slowly destroying my things and occasionally clamping down on my butt. Then I got <a href="http://www.saddlebackleather.com/65-product-categories-Leather-Bags-Leather-Briefcases-Leather-Suitcases-Leather-Backpacks">this</a> minimal, functional, solid wallet, guaranteed for 100 years. Saddleback Leather Company creates a great experience, guiding you from the build of the leather to selecting the right color. If you’re in the market for a wallet, this is the way to go.</p>
