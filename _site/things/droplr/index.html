<p>The idea of <a href="http://droplr.com">Droplr</a> is simple—it’s a Mac application that lives in your menu bar, and you can drop files on it to share them. This uploads your file and automatically copies a shortened URL to your clipboard so you can share it. This works for all types of files, too. <a href="http://drp.ly/3Zn6t">Images</a>, <a href="http://drp.ly/3Af6M">PDFs</a>, ZIP archives, and more. It even automatically colors and <a href="http://droplr.com/9lw2J">formats code</a>. It’s become an indispensable part of my workflow for sharing bits of information.</p>
